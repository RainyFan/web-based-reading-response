    <h1 id="title">Reading Response to Louise Drulhe, Critical Atlas of the Internet.</h1>

    <p> <mark>Quote 1</mark>  Nevertheless, Internet also remains this unique single space shared worldwide. Our aim here is to study this paradox between the unicity and diversity of the internet.
        The internet we use is actually a projection of itself through the prism of locality. Internet is a single entity, but with a myriad of territorial projections.</p>
        <p> <mark>Quote 2</mark>  Looking at internet is like looking at a landscape through a window but we can’t leave the room and see the whole stretch for internet which only exists within a frame. It’s space is composed like the composition of a painting. The frame delimits internet space and influences its arrangement; Internet architecture depends on this frame. Web windows work as modular frames, fitting in an infinite number of formats. </p>

            <button type="button" class="next">It is so interesting the concept of internet is changing through time both literally and figuratively. When I just start using social media, the time of using it is limited since it will show there’s no more new information. Compared with the old times, the move of scrolling down the screen is always an incomplete process, information overloaded, instant message, new content, vanish mode, message deleted after reading, restricted function, mute, dislike, share, like, comment. The social webpage develops a game-like system to make them additive and psychologically make users obsessed with them without consciousness. For example, there’s time I always feel anxiety when I open instagram. As a dancer, I follow over 1k dancers on instagram before. Initially, the purpose is to inspire myself. But then I start to become not selective about who I follow, since the “follow” button looks so tempting and easy to click. “Just follow tase cool people, their contents are definitely helpful for you.” That’s what I thought based on a single, random 10 second video of someone. The overwhelming information after I open instagram, the non-stop new posts and story with low quality giving me anxiety to constantly post dance video as a dancer. The process of exploring turns into pressure and anxiety. It was intruding me, undid me, and slowed me down, because I would choose to stay away from dance rather than practice. “ Instagram right now become your resume” is a controversial thing for dance industry. But this is just one example for how internet alternate the development of an industry. It becomes the same with industry involving performances. The online entertainment are forcing traditional off-line industry, theater, performance venue, magic show, circus, to make changes.
